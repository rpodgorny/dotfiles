# when outputting certificates, view user IDs distinctly from keys:
fixed-list-mode
# short-keyids are trivially spoofed; it's easy to create a long-keyid collision; if you care about strong key identifiers, you always want to see the fingerprint: 
keyid-format 0xlong
with-fingerprint
# when multiple digests are supported by all recipients, choose the strongest one:
personal-digest-preferences SHA512 SHA384 SHA256 SHA224
# preferences chosen for new keys should prioritize stronger algorithms: 
default-preference-list SHA512 SHA384 SHA256 SHA224 AES256 AES192 AES CAST5 BZIP2 ZLIB ZIP Uncompressed
# If you use a graphical environment (and even if you don't) you should be using an agent:
# (similar arguments as  https://www.debian-administration.org/users/dkg/weblog/64)
use-agent
# You should always know at a glance which User IDs gpg thinks are legitimately bound to the keys in your keyring:
verify-options show-uid-validity
list-options show-uid-validity
# include an unambiguous indicator of which key made a signature:
# (see http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.mail.notmuch.general/3721/focus=7234)
sig-notation issuer-fpr@notations.openpgp.fifthhorseman.net=%g
# when making an OpenPGP certification, use a stronger digest than the default SHA1:
cert-digest-algo SHA512
